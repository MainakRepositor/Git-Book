<h2>Welcome to Git-Book</h2>
<h3>The world's most light-weight, easy to use and insightful Github user directory look up</h3>


<hr>


<h3>Why this name?</h3>
<h4>We all must be very familiar with phonebooks, which we use to lookup a person's details like telephone or mobile number, address etc. if we know his / her name or contact number. In Git Book too, we will use the Github user's username as a primary key (as Github ensures this is unique) to look up for any Github user</h4>
